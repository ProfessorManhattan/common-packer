      $ Report formatting errors with Prettier

      This task will run Prettier on the project and list the possible fixes without automatically
      applying the fixes. It will report mistakes like inconsistent indent lengths, trailing spaces,
      and more. This task is a wrapper for the `npm run lint:prettier` command. It will use the configuration
      specified in the `package.json` file under the `prettier` key.

      If this command is incompatible with a file then you can add the file to the `.prettierignore`
      file.

      For more information on Prettier, see: https://prettier.io/

      $ Report possible errors in shell scripts using Shellcheck

      Shellcheck is a tool that reports warnings and suggestions for shell (e.g. bash) scripts. This
      task is a wrapper for the `npm run lint:shellcheck` command. The npm command scans the project
      for files ending with `.sh` or `.sh.j2` and runs Shellcheck on them. Files in the following folders
      are ignored:
        * .cache        * .husky
        * .git          * node_modules
        * .husky        * slim_test

    cmds:
      - npm run lint:shellcheck
    sources:
      - '**/*.(sh|sh.j2)'
