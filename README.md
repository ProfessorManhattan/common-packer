# Packer Project Common Files

This repository includes common files that are shared throughout our various Packer repositories. It is used in conjunction with the `.start.sh` file that is present in all our Packer projects. The `.start.sh` file synchronizes various files from this repository.

To synchronize one of the Packer projects, run the following command in the root of the project:

```shell
bash .start.sh
```
